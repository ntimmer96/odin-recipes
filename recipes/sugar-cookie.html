    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      These will be some of the best sugar cookies you've ever made! They're so
      soft and chewy, melting in you mouth after each bite.
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 3/4 cups (218 g) all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar, plus 1/4 cup (50 g) for rolling</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (113 g) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
      <li>1 large egg, room temperature</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream
        together the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy,
        about 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Add the egg and mix until well combined.</li>
      <li>
        Add the vanilla and almond extract, mixing on low speed until
        incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder
        and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the butter and egg mixture and mix
        on low speed for about 20 to 30 seconds just until the dough begins to
        come together. Do not over mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoop 2-ounce (3 tablespoons) portions of the cookie dough and use your
        hands to roll the dough into balls. Roll the dough in a small bowl
        filled with the 1/4 cup granulated sugar and coat all sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the cookie dough balls on a parchment lined baking sheet and chill
        for 30 minutes. While the dough chills, preheat the oven to 350Â°F. When
        the dough is chilled, place the balls on a separate parchment lined
        baking sheet, spacing them 2 to 3 inches apart.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 11 to 12 minutes or until the edges are set and begin to turn a
        golden brown. The tops of the cookies should by puffy and cracked. Do
        not over bake. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow to cool on the
        baking sheet for 10 minutes before using a spatula to transfer the
        cookies to a wire cooling rack.
