    </p>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 strips thick-cut bacon</li>
      <li>8 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>10 ounces frozen spinach</li>
      <li>1/2 cup crumbled feta</li>
      <li>1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan</li>
      <li>2 sheets frozen puff pastry</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
      <li class="main">
        Place racks in the upper and lower thirds of your oven and preheat the
        oven to 400 degrees F. Bake bacon according to these directions for
        Baked Bacon. Let cool, then chop or crumble into bits. Spray 18 total
        cups in two standard muffin tins with nonstick spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, place the cream cheese pieces in a wide microwave-safe bowl.
        Microwave in 10 second bursts until the cream cheese is very soft and
        melty but not so hot that it is steaming. Stir in 1 egg, garlic powder,
        black pepper, and oregano until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate large mixing bowl, combine the spinach, feta, Parmesan,
        and chopped bacon with a fork, breaking apart the spinach. Scrape the
        cream cheese mixture on top of the spinach mixture, then stir the
        ingredients until well combined. Taste and adjust seasoning as desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unfold the first sheet of pastry on a lightly floured surface and gently
        roll to remove any creases (it will be a 10- or 11-inch square). Cut the
        pastry sheet into 9 even squares (three squares across and three
        downâ€”they will be a little more than 3 inches on each side). Line the
        wells of the muffin pan with the pastry squares so that the center is
        pressed on the bottom of the muffin cups and the corners over hang the
        sides (see photo in blog post above). If needed, stretch the squares to
        be a bit larger so that they extend all the way up the sides. With a
        spoon or small scoop like this one, portion the spinach filling by
        heaping tablespoons and place it in the center of each muffin cup,
        dividing it evenly among the 18 cups.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the four points of each puff pastry square together towards the
        center so that they cover the filling, then lightly press them together
        in the middle (no need for them to totally stick or seal). In a small
        bowl, beat the remaining egg to make an egg wash and brush it over the
        tops of the pastry (you will not need the whole egg).
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the puffs, one muffin tin on each rack, for 21 to 24 minutes, until
        puffy and deeply golden, switching the pans' position on the upper and
        lower racks halfway through. Allow to cool for 10 minutes, then run a
        knife carefully around the edges to gently loosen them. Transfer to a
        wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.

    </ol>
